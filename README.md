My project will allow users to search tweets by a keyword. 
The program will return a list of tweets that have been retweeted and find the times 
between the original tweet and retweeted tweets.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>tweet</th><th>time of tweet</th><th>time of retweet</th><th>how long did it take?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>"E=mc^2" -Albert Einstein</th><td>12:10</td><td>12:12</td><td>00:02</td>
  </tr>
</table>
